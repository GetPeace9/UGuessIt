## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create an entertaining and interactive number guessing game. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and a limited number of attempts. It aims to provide a fun way to practice number guessing while offering a visually appealing interface and tracking high scores.

## Solution
To achieve the project goals, the following solutions were implemented:
- **Algorithms**: Random number generation for the target number, feedback algorithms for warmer/colder hints.
- **Technologies**: Python for the core logic, `tkinter` for the graphical user interface.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `tkinter`: To create a modern and user-friendly interface.
  - `json`: To store and manage high scores.
- **Tools**: Python 3.x, a text editor or IDE for writing and editing code.

### Key Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard levels.
- **Personalized Experience**: Players are prompted to enter their name.
- **High Score Tracking**: High scores are saved and displayed using a JSON file.
- **Summer-Themed UI**: Bright, summer colors to make the game visually appealing.
- **Feedback Messages**: Real-time feedback on guesses to make the game more interactive.
